# AI Changelog Generator

This is a two-part app that uses AI to generate user-facing changelogs from GitHub commit messages.

## Part 1: Developer Tool

Input a public repo owner, public project name, and date range

Fetches commits from the GitHub API

Uses OpenAI to summarize relevant changes

Lets you edit the title/description before publishing

## Part 2: Public Changelog Page

Lists all saved changelogs

Each changelog is expandable, with clean formatting

Data persists using a lightweight SQLite DB via Prisma

## üß† Notes & Decisions

This app currently assumes a single-repo use case and does not support managing changelogs across multiple repositories. In a real-world production setting, I would set up unique URLs or IDs per repo and persist changelogs separately for each. For the purposes of this project, I‚Äôve prioritized the core UX and AI integration over multi-repo management.

It also assumes that the user will be fetching the commit history of a _public_ repo. Authorization could be added in the future but did not make sense for a MVP.

Minimal validation is in place (e.g., no future dates, all fields required), but more could easily be added.

I would 100% modularize this so that the pages/generate file did not hold so much JSX and so many functions. But again, it kept it cleaner for an MVP to just keep all the state and functionality in the top level.

I used AI tools to help set up the Prisma and SQLite database functionality, error logging, and some component styling (especially colors).

## üîß Built With

-   React
-   TypeScript
-   OpenAI API
-   GitHub API
-   Prisma
-   SQLite

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. You'll need valid credentials from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). Once you have that, add an `.env` file with:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
OPENAI_API_KEY={your_open_ai_key}
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
```

If you don‚Äôt plan to run local writes or migrations, you can use any valid-looking `DATABASE_URL` to satisfy Prisma.

**Note:** If you want full DB functionality, you can run:

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. `cd backend`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npx prisma migrate dev`
7. cd back out to root, and run `npm run dev`
8. can optionally just run the front end with `npm start`
